# Lost Minions — Organization Hub

Welcome to **Lost Minions**, a collective of makers, gamers, and coders turning imagination into code, prints, and pixels.  
This repository serves as the **central configuration and community home** for all Lost Minions projects.

## About the Project

Lost Minions is a creative network spanning 3D printing, automation, and gaming.  
What began as a small group of builders has grown into a workshop of digital and physical experiments —  
each repo a different kind of creation:

> _Automation scripts that keep our worlds running._  
> _Custom 3D prints born from pixels and code._  
> _Legacy gaming tools, forums, and archives that remind us where we started._

Every Lost Minions repository — from websites and bots to design libraries — connects back to this shared creative core.

## Shared Standards

Across all Lost Minions projects we maintain a unified label and metadata system:

- **Core areas:** `website`, `automation`, `3d-print`, `game-tool`
- **Maintenance:** `task`, `enhancement`, `documentation`
- **Standard GitHub:** `bug`, `help wanted`, `question`, etc.

This shared vocabulary keeps creative and technical work organized across code, art, and fabrication.
